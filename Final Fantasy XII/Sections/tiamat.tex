\begin{enumerate}
\item Get on Chocobo. When you get off, check for chest, and try to Berserk \basch\ with \penelo\ and then \vaan, then get back on the Chocobo. If you land it, take him out of the part for \balthier.
\item Get on chocobo again, can repeat the berserk before the loading zone.
\vaanf Protect \vaan\ while running, make sure it's up for Tiamate. Larsa has healing gambits, so can stop \flee\ if anyone is below 50\%
\item Cast Traveler, open the Menu to check Step Count. Turn Battle Speed to Min.
\item Battle Speed to Max. Berserk \basch
