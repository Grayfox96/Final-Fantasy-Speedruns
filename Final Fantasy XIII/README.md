# FF13-Notes
Final Fantasy 13 Any% Speedrun Notes.

This main branch is the most up to date notes. Some of the strategies might be cutting edge stuff that might not fully work, but should be better.

There is a different document for PC and Console Strats, so please make sure that you download the correct one.

For PC, the notes are also split between Snow Adamenchelid and Lightning Adamenchelid. Make sure to download the one that you want to use in Chatper 12.
